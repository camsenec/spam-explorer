Hello!

My nickname is lindy34.
I hacked this mailbox over half a year ago (you received this letter from you),
I've been monitoring you for a long time by infecting your operating system with a virus I created (Trojan horse).

If you change your password after that, it doesn't matter. My virus intercepted all caching data on your computer
Saved access automatically for me.

I have access to all your accounts, social networks, emails and browsing history.
Therefore, I have all your contacts, files, photos and video data from your computer.

I was most struck by the intimate content sites you visit from time to time.
You have a very wild imagination, I tell you!

During your pleasure and entertainment, I took screenshots through the camera on your device in sync with what you were seeing.
Oh my God! You are so funny and rocking!

I don't think all of your contacts want to get these screenshots, right?
If you have the same opinion, I think $ 824 is a pretty fair price to destroy the stains I made.

Please send the specified amount to my BTC wallet (Bitcoin): 1J7gBRcZxBTJwLA1K3Qy89NR6bxn6uAkZF
As soon as I receive the above amount, I guarantee that the data will be deleted, I don't need it.

Otherwise, these files and your site visit history will be sent from your device to all your contacts.
I have saved all your email correspondence! This will also be sent to your contacts!

As soon as you read it-I will know about it!
You have 50 hours!

I've done a lot of work looking into you! You don't see security!
Go only to proven resources and don't enter your password anywhere!
goodbye!
