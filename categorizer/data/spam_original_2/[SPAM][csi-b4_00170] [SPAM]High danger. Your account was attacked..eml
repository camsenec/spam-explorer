Hello!

I have very bad news for you.
17/07/2019 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your acc=
ount csi-b4@edu.kobe-u.ac.jp.
You can check it - I sent this message from your account.

So, you can change the password, yes.. But my malware intercepts it every=
 time.

How I made it:
In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulne=
rability.
I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it.
When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.

After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book=
, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all=
 your contacts).

A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of=
 btc to unlock.
But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by =
what I saw!!!
I'm talk you about sites for adults.

I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away f=
rom the normal course!

And I got an idea....
I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you underst=
and what it is about, huh?).
After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your de=
vice) and glued them together.
Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular!

I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friend=
s, relatives or colleagues.
I think $904 is a very, very small amount for my silence.
Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of tim=
e!

Pay ONLY in Bitcoins!
My BTC wallet: 15yF8WkUg8PRjJehYW4tGdqcyzc4z7dScM

You do not know how to use bitcoins?
Enter a query in any search engine: "how to replenish btc wallet".
It's extremely easy

For this payment I give you two days (48 hours).
As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work.

After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be se=
lf-destruct automatically.
If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will =
be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your "en=
joys".

I hope you understand your situation.
- Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and scre=
enshots is already uploaded to a remote server)
- Do not try to contact me (you yourself will see that this is impossible=
, I sent you an email from your account)
- Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destr=
oying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote serv=
er.

P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not di=
sturb you again after payment!
 This is the word of honor hacker.

I also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This w=
ay you will no longer fall into a similar situation.

Do not hold evil! I just do my job.
Good luck.
