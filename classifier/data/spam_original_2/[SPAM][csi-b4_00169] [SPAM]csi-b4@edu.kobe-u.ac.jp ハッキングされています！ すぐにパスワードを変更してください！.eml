Hello!

I have bad news for you.
July 23, 2019-On this day, I hacked your operating system and gained full access to your account (csi-b4@edu.kobe-u.ac.jp).

How was it:
There was a vulnerability in the software of the router that was connected that day.
I first hacked this router and put malicious code on it.
When I connected to the internet, my Trojan was installed in the operating system of your device.

Then I have saved the complete data on your disk (I have all your address book, site browsing history, all files, phone numbers, addresses of all your contacts).

I wanted to lock your device. I wanted money to unlock it.
But I saw the sites you visit on a regular basis, and was shocked by your favorite resources.
I'm talking about a site for adults.

I say-you are a big pervert. Infinite fantasy!

Then the idea came to my mind.
I made a screenshot of an intimate website you are having fun with (I'm talking about your joy, do you understand?).
Then I made a photo of your joy (using the camera on your device). Everything went great!

I strongly believe that I don't want to show this photo to your relatives, friends and colleagues.
I think $ 827 is very small due to my silence.
Besides, I spent a lot of time on you!

I only accept Bitcoins.
My BTC wallet: 1K9QiwYSU6tmysgQESkb1TZPaY2hyjeEaA

Don't know how to refill your Bitcoin wallet?
For any search engine, write "How to send money to btc wallet".
It's easier than sending money to a credit card!

For payment, we will provide you for exactly 2 days or more (50 hours to be exact).
Don't worry, the timer will start the moment you open this letter. Yes, yes. It's already started!

After payment, my virus and dirty photos will be automatically self-destructed.
If I do not receive the specified amount from you, your device will be blocked and all your contacts will receive your "joy" and photos.

I hope you are wise.
-Don't try to find and destroy my virus! (All data has already been uploaded to the remote server) --Don't try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent an email from your account)
――Various security services do not help you. Formatting the disk or destroying the device will not help because your data is already on the remote server.

P.S. I guarantee you will not get in the way again after payment.
This is the hacker's honor code.

From now on, we recommend using a good antivirus and updating it regularly (several times a day)!

Don't get angry with me, everyone is doing their job.
Farewell.</div></body></html>
