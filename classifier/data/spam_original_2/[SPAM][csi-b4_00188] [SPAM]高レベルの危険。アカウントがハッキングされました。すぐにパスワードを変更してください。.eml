Hello!

I'm a hacker who hacked your operating system.
I also have full access to your account.

Do you change your password regularly?
It won't help you (my software updates the password every time).

I have been watching you for a few months now.
Your device is infected through the adult site you visit.

If you don't fully understand everything, I'll explain it.
I use the Trojan virus and I have full access to your device.
That is, I can see everything on the screen and turn on the camera and microphone, but you don't know about it.

I also have access to email contacts and messengers.

Why doesn't your antivirus detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses a driver.
I update his signature every 4 hours, so antivirus does not respond to threats.

I created a video using a camcorder on your device.
In this video you masturbate on the left half of the screen, on the right you will see a video clip, you were watching.

With just one mouse click I can send this video to all your acquaintances, friends and relatives.
That would be an unprecedented shame for you.

If you want to prevent this, transfer $ 950 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you don't know how to do this, write "Buy Bitcoin" to Google).

My Bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 18rpwHqLpfy13uvyM1nyqotoLCNY2fsj2s

After receiving the payment, I will delete all these embarrassing videos forever. I also remove my virus from your operating system.
If I don't get money-the video will be delivered to all contacts from this device.
Payment must be made within 48 hours (2 days).

The timer will start as soon as you open this letter. Time will go soon.

It doesn't make sense to file a complaint somewhere because this email can't be tracked like my Bitcoin address.
Make no mistake.

If it turns out that you have shared this message with others, the video will be delivered immediately.

Postscript. To prevent the same situation, you should update your antivirus every hour.

We hope the success.
